# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease using machine learning algorithms.  
It analyzes medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate to build accurate classification models.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is `heart.csv` which contains the following features:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type (cp)  
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)  
- Cholesterol (chol)  
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)  
- Resting ECG (restecg)  
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)  
- Exercise induced angina (exang)  
- ST depression (oldpeak)  
- Slope  
- Number of major vessels (ca)  
- Thalassemia (thal)  
- Target (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)
